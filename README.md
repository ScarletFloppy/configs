# Configs
My fresh install configs and setup scripts

## Goals:
- Create and maintain an easy to use set of scripts for use when re-formating my machines.
- Help myself and possibly others (if forked) get my/their systems back to a base operating state after reconfig.
- Etc. I'll think of more goals later.
